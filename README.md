This is a functioning version of a game I have made for a course on circuits, compilers and programming languages.

The game has been written in the Jack language for which we wrote the virtual CPU, assembler and compiler.

The instructions can be found in the attached .pdf file.

To run the game upload the folder's filed to this website: https://funkschy.github.io/nand-to-browser/
